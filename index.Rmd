## Documentation

### Introduction

> We are interested in exploring the relationship between other variables and miles per gallon (MPG)

> The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

### Usage
- Select any other varriable on the side bar to see its relationship with MPG"),
- The Regression Model Tab show the actual relationship with the model info beneath
- The box plot shows a plot of distribution of the varriable in relationship to MPG
- The Show Outliers Check box shows other data point which are outliers in the box plot

## Dataset - Format

```{r}
library(datasets)
head(mtcars, 3)
```

**A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.**

| Index | Field | Detail |
------- | ----- | ------ |
| [, 1] | mpg | Miles/(US) gallon |
| [, 2]  | cyl | Number of cylinders |
| [, 3]	| disp | Displacement (cu.in.) |
| [, 4]	| hp | Gross horsepower |
| [, 5]	| drat | Rear axle ratio |
| [, 6]	| wt | Weight (lb/1000) |
| [, 7]	| qsec | 1/4 mile time |
| [, 8]	| vs | V/S |
| [, 9]	| am | Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) |
| [,10]	| gear | Number of forward gears |
| [,11]	| carb | Number of carburetors |

## Analysis - main code

```r
  formulaTextPoint <- reactive({
    paste("mpg ~", "as.integer(", input$variable, ")")  })
  
  fit <- reactive({
    lm(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()), data=mpgData)  })
  ...
  output$fit <- renderPrint({
    summary(fit()) })
  
  output$mpgPlot <- renderPlot({
    with(mpgData, {
      plot(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()))
      abline(fit(), col=2)
    })  })

```
